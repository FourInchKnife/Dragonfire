## Cult of Flame

Though the Cult of Flame may seem like the evil bad guys from the start, they have actually been duped just as much as everyone else. Their job is to appease the [dragon][dragon] with sacrifices of any type of creature at the entrance to the volcano. By doing this on a bi-weekly basis, they keep the dragon happy and away from others.

### Local Community

Because of the manner and frequency of the sacrifices, the local community does not look kindly on the Cult of Flame. Many times, cult members have been stoned for entering [Home][home-city]. Any PCs associated with the cult will likely be given the cold shoulder whenever they talk to an in-town NPC who recognizes them as such. People don't like having their livestock (and sometimes children if no animals are on hand) sacrificed to a volcano.
