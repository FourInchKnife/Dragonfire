## The Dragon

I don't have a name yet D:

The adult red dragon is the BBEG of [Dragonfire][home]. It has been terrorizing the entire area (with the exception of the area protected by [The House][house]). To appease the dragon, [The Cult of Flame][cult] sacrifices creatures near the [volcano][volcano]. When the dragon is fed, no one dies.

In your campaign, your PCs may end up trying to destroy the [Cult][cult]. If this happens and no one keeps the dragon fed, then it will unleash its fury on Dragonfire and return to terrorizing everyone.

The dragon's chamber is in the center of [Mount Gushmore][volcano], so your PCs will likely need to interact with the [Cult][cult] before they can reach the dragon.
